Django Profile
==============

This is a user private zone/profile management application, allowing
the user to take control of his account and insert information about
him in his profile.

Inside this package you will find a demo application which will show
you what can be accomplished with the rest of the utilities included
in the package.

For installation instructions, see the file "INSTALL.txt" in this
directory.


Options you can use on settings.py:

WEBSEARCH. Allow the users to select images from Picasa web or flickr directly, making use of the web API of these sites (requires the installation of some python modules, read INSTALL.txt). Example:
	WEBSEARCH = True
