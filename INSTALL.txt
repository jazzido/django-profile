-- Requeriments --
------------------

First of all, the requerimient to run this software is:

	* Django version 0.96 or greater.

	* The Python Imaging Library:
		* python-imaging package (on Debian or Ubuntu).
		* Source: http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

	* The Google Data APIs (Optional):
		* Download from: http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/

You can see a demo of which can be accomplished here:

	http://profile.coredump.es

or here (Google AppEngine branch of this application):

	http://django-profile.appspot.com


-----------------
-- Quick guide --
-----------------

You can run the demo supplied with this software package following these steps:

* Make django visible in your python path. You could import the last version
from the repository executing this command on this directory:

	$ svn co http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk/django

* Make the "userprofile" and "account" modules visible to your PYTHONPATH.

* Download and put on the PYTHONPATH the Google Data APIs. This allow to select avatars directly from Picasaweb:
	$ wget http://gdata-python-client.googlecode.com/files/gdata.py-1.1.0.tar.gz
	$ tar zxvf gdata.py-1.1.0.tar.gz
	Now move the gdata.py-1.1.0/src/gdata and gdata.py-1.1.0/src/atom directories to your PYTHONPATH.

* Fill the Continents and Countries information with the database supplied. Follow this steps:
	$ cd demo
	$ python manage.py loaddata userprofile-continent
	$ python manage.py loaddata userprofile-country

* Go to the "demo" directory located in this directory and run:

	$ python manage.py syncdb
and
	$ python manage.py runserver


You can now connect to the django web server and try the demo. 

	http://127.0.0.1:8000


* You will need a valid e-mail server to try the e-mail validation process. 
  Fill this information in settings.py:

# e-mail settings
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = ''
EMAIL_HOST = ''
EMAIL_HOST_USER = ''
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = ''

* You also will need a valid Google Maps API Key. Obtain one for your site name here:

	http://www.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html

  Put the obtained key in the constant APIKEY located in the file 'settings.py'.

-- Custom install guide --
--------------------------
Once you've seen what can be done, you could integrate django-profile with your custom
software. Basically, you need these things:

* Add django and the required modules accesible from your PYTHONPATH (Look at the demo
  section).

* Add this directive to the 'settings.py' file:
	AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE = 'userprofile.profile'

* Add this modules to the INSTALLED_APPS section of your settings.py:
	'userprofile',
	'account',

* Add this lines to your urls.py file:

    (r'^profile/', include('userprofile.urls')),
    (r'^accounts/', include('account.urls')),

* Make the "media" directory accesible as your media content, or add the following line
  to urls.py to test it:

    # Serves media content. WARNING!! Only for development uses
    (r'^site_media/(?P<path>.*)$', 'django.views.static.serve', {'document_root': '../media/'}),

    This sample assumes that settings.MEDIA_URL="site_media", if you want to use another URI for
    the media content, you also need to change the paths /site_media/.. of the static content 
    files (CSS and javascript files).

* Fill the needed data of countries and continents of the profile database with these commands:
	$ python manage.py loaddata userprofile-continent
	$ python manage.py loaddata userprofile-country

* You will need to fill the e-mail server configuration of settings.py (if you didn't have it yet)
  to try the e-mail validation process.

* You will need a valid Google Maps API Key for your site. Put the key in the constant APIKEY located
  in the file 'settings.py'.

* Add the 'templates' directory to the TEMPLATES_DIRS section of your 'settings.py'. 
  You can also modify the default templates supplied with the modules 'account' and 'userprofile'
