-----------------
-- Quick guide --
-----------------

You can run the demo supplied with this software package following these steps:

* Make django visible in your python path. You could import the last version
from the repository executing this command on this directory:

	$ svn co http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk/django

* Go to the "demo" directory located in this directory and run:

	$ python manage.py syncdb
and
	$ python manage.py runserver


You can now connect to the django web server and try the demo. 

Optional:

* Fill the Continents and Countries information with the database supplied. Follow
  this steps:

$ python manage.py shell
>>> from profile.models import Continent,Country
>>> Continent().importdata()
>>> Country().importdata()


* You will need a valid e-mail server to try the e-mail validation process. 
  Fill this information in settings.py:

# e-mail settings
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = ''
EMAIL_HOST = ''
EMAIL_HOST_USER = ''
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = ''

* You also will need a valid Google Maps API Key. Obtain one for your site name here:

	http://www.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html

  Put the obtained key in the constant APIKEY located in the file 'settings.py'.

-- Custom install guide --
--------------------------
Once you've seen what can be done, you could integrate django-profile with your custom
software. Basically, you need these things:

* Add django and the required modules accesible from your PYTHON_PATH (Look at the demo
  section).

* Add this directive to the 'settings.py' file:
	AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE = 'profile.profile'

* Add this modules to the INSTALLED_APPS section of your settings.py:
	'profile',
	'account',

* Add this lines to your urls.py file:

    (r'^profile/', include('profile.urls')),
    (r'^accounts/', include('account.urls')),

* Make the "media" directory accesible as your media content, or add the following line
  to urls.py to test it:

    # Serves media content. WARNING!! Only for development uses
    (r'^site_media/(?P<path>.*)$', 'django.views.static.serve', {'document_root': '../media/'}),

    This sample assumes that settings.MEDIA_URL="site_media", if you want to use another URI for
    the media content, you also need to change the paths /site_media/.. of the static content 
    files (CSS and javascript files).

* Fill the needed data of countries and continents of the profile database with these commands:
	$ python manage.py shell
	>>> from profile.models import Continent,Country
	>>> Continent().importdata()
	>>> Country().importdata()

* You will need to fill the e-mail server configuration of settings.py (if you didn't have it yet)
  to try the e-mail validation process.

* You will need a valid Google Maps API Key for your site. Put the key in the constant APIKEY located
  in the file 'settings.py'.

* Add the 'templates' directory to the TEMPLATES_DIRS section of your 'settings.py'. 
  You can also modify the default templates supplied with the modules 'account' and 'profile'
