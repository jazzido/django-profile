Quick install
-------------

First of all, the requerimient to run this software is:

	* Django version 0.96 or greater.

	* The great package "django-registration", which you can find here:
		http://code.google.com/p/django-registration

	* The Python Imaging Library:

You can see a demo of which can be accomplished here:

-- Quick install guide --
-------------------------

You can run the demo supplied with this software package following these steps:

* Make django visible in your python path. You could import the last version
from the repository executing this command on this directory:

	$ svn co http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk/django

* Download the dependencies of this software inside this directory. 
This software depends on django-registration. You can download the last 
version with this command:

	$ svn checkout http://django-registration.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/registration/

* Go to the "demo" directory located in this directory and run:

	$ python manage.py runserver


You can now connect to the django web server and try the demo. You will need a valid e-mail server
to try the e-mail validation process. You would need to fill this information of settings.py:

# e-mail settings
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = ''
EMAIL_HOST = ''
EMAIL_HOST_USER = ''
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = ''

-- Custom install guide --
--------------------------
Once you've seen what can be done, you could integrate django-profile with your custom
software. Basically, you need these things:

* Add django and the required modules accesible from your PYTHON_PATH (Look at the demo
  section).
* Add this modules to the INSTALLED_APPS section of your settings.py:
	'profile',
	'account',
	'registration'

* Add this lines to your urls.py file:

    (r'^profile/', include('profile.urls')),
    (r'^accounts/', include('account.urls')),

* Make the "media" directory accesible as your media content, or add the following line
  to urls.py to test it:

    # Serves media content. WARNING!! Only for development uses
    (r'^site_media/(?P<path>.*)$', 'django.views.static.serve', {'document_root': '../media/'}),

* Fill the needed data of countries and continents of the profile database with these commands:
	$ python manage.py shell
	>>> from profile.models import Continent,Country
	>>> Continent().importdata()
	>>> Country().importdata()

* You will need to fill the e-mail server configuration of settings.py (if you didn't have it yet)
  to try the e-mail validation process.

* You can modify the default templates supplied with the modules 'account' and 'profile'
